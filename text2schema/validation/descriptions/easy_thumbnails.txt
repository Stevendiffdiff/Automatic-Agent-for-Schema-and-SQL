### Functional Description:  

The software is a **thumbnail generation and management system** that creates and stores resized versions (thumbnails) of source images. It tracks the relationship between original images and their thumbnails, along with the dimensions of each thumbnail variant.  

#### Core Functionality:  
1. **Source Image Storage**  
   - Stores original images with a unique identifier, file name, storage location hash, and modification timestamp.  

2. **Thumbnail Generation & Storage**  
   - Generates thumbnails from source images, storing each thumbnail with:  
     - A reference to the source image.  
     - A unique identifier, file name, storage location hash, and modification timestamp.  

3. **Thumbnail Dimension Management**  
   - Supports multiple size variants per thumbnail (e.g., small, medium, large).  
   - Tracks width and height (in pixels) for each variant, linked to the parent thumbnail.  

#### Key Relationships:  
- **Thumbnail → Source Image**: Each thumbnail is derived from one source image.  
- **Thumbnail Dimensions → Thumbnail**: Each thumbnail can have multiple dimension records (e.g., different sizes).  

#### Use Cases:  
- Dynamically serving appropriately sized thumbnails for different UI contexts (e.g., gallery view, detail view).  
- Efficient storage and retrieval of thumbnails by source image or dimensions.  

#### Engineering Implications:  
- The schema supports **scalable thumbnail generation** with traceability back to source files.  
- **Storage optimization**: Uses hashes (likely file paths or identifiers) to reference images without duplication.  
- **Flexible resizing**: Nullable width/height allows for dynamic or unconstrained resizing.  

This system is well-suited for media-heavy applications like CMS platforms, social networks, or e-commerce sites.
