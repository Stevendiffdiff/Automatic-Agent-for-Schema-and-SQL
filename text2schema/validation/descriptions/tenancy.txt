### Functional Description: Tagging System

**Core Purpose**:  
The software implements a flexible tagging system that allows users to categorize and organize different types of content (objects) using customizable tags. This is a many-to-many relationship system where:  
- Multiple tags can be applied to a single object  
- A single tag can be applied to multiple objects  

**Key Components**:  

1. **Tag Management**  
   - Tags are defined by a unique name (e.g., "Python", "Tutorial")  
   - Each tag has a URL-friendly slug (e.g., "python", "tutorial") for web routing  
   - Tags are stored as independent entities, decoupled from the objects they categorize  

2. **Object Tagging**  
   - Any object in the system (identified by `object_id`) can be tagged  
   - The system supports tagging across different content types (e.g., articles, videos, users) via `content_type_id`  
   - Tag associations are stored as lightweight relationships, enabling efficient filtering/queries  

3. **Relationship Model**  
   - Many-to-one relationship between tagged items and tags (a tag can be reused across many objects)  
   - Junction table (`taggit_taggeditem`) resolves the many-to-many relationship between objects and tags  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- **Extensible**: Designed to tag arbitrary content types without schema modifications  
- **Web-friendly**: Slug fields enable clean URLs for tag-based navigation  
- **Normalized**: Tags are stored once and referenced, preventing duplication  

**Example Use Cases**:  
- Categorizing blog posts by topic  
- Filtering user-generated content by attributes  
- Implementing faceted search/filtering  

This description gives engineers enough context to design a similar tagging system while focusing on the functional behavior rather than implementation details. The schema can be derived from the relationships and constraints implied here.
