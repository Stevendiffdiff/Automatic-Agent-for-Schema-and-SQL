### Functional Description of the File Management System:

This is a **hierarchical file management system** with user permissions, clipboard functionality, and specialized image handling. The core functionality includes:

1. **File & Folder Management**  
   - Supports nested folder structures using a nested set model (lft/rght/tree_id/level) for efficient hierarchy operations  
   - Each file/folder has ownership (user), timestamps, and can track original filenames  
   - Files maintain integrity through SHA1 hashing and size tracking  

2. **User System Integration**  
   - Full user authentication system with groups  
   - All file operations are user-aware (ownership tracked for both files and folders)  

3. **Clipboard Functionality**  
   - Per-user clipboard storage for file operations  
   - Supports storing multiple file references in clipboard items  

4. **Permission System**  
   - Granular folder permissions (read/edit/add children)  
   - Supports user-specific, group-wide, and global permission settings  

5. **Image Handling**  
   - Specialized image metadata storage (dimensions, author, copyright, alt text)  
   - Inherits all base file properties while adding image-specific fields  

6. **Thumbnail Generation**  
   - Configurable thumbnail presets with dimension and cropping options  

7. **Polymorphic Content**  
   - Supports extending file types through Django's content type system  

Key Relationships:  
- Users own folders/files and have clipboards  
- Folders contain files and other folders (nested hierarchy)  
- Permissions apply to folders and cascade to contents  
- Images are specialized file types with additional metadata  

The system appears designed for **web-based content management**, with particular attention to:  
- Media asset management (images with metadata)  
- Team collaboration (permissions system)  
- Batch operations (clipboard functionality)  
- Content organization (hierarchical folder structure)  

The schema suggests this powers a CMS-like interface where users need to manage files with varying permission levels, particularly for media-rich content.
