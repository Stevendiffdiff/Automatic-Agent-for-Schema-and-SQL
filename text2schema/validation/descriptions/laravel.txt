### Functional Description of the Software:

The software is a **community-driven discussion platform** with GitHub integration, designed to facilitate threaded conversations, user engagement, and content organization. The core functionality revolves around:

1. **User Management**  
   - Supports GitHub OAuth (stores GitHub ID/username) and traditional email/password authentication  
   - Includes account confirmation, password resets, and user banning capabilities  
   - Tracks user profiles with bios and display names  

2. **Discussion System**  
   - Thread-based conversations with subjects and rich text bodies  
   - Reply functionality supporting nested conversations (replies to threads or other replies)  
   - Solution marking (thread authors can designate a reply as the accepted solution)  

3. **Engagement Features**  
   - Polymorphic liking system for various content types (threads, replies, etc.)  
   - Subscription model allowing users to follow specific content  
   - Notification system for user activity tracking  

4. **Content Organization**  
   - Tagging system with slug-based routing for categorization  
   - Polymorphic tagging supporting multiple content types  

5. **Technical Infrastructure**  
   - Background job processing with failure tracking  
   - Standard database migration patterns  

### Key Relationships:  
- Users author threads and replies  
- Threads contain replies and can have a marked solution  
- All core content types (threads/replies) support:  
  - Tagging (via taggables)  
  - Liking  
  - Subscriptions  
  - Notifications  

The system emphasizes **extensible engagement patterns** through polymorphic relationships, allowing consistent interaction models across different content types while maintaining relational integrity. The GitHub integration suggests a technical audience, likely developers or technical communities.
