### Functional Description of the CMS Platform:

This is a **multilingual content management system** with **user authentication**, **role-based permissions**, and **plugin architecture**. The system manages hierarchical pages with editable parts, supports file/image resources, and tracks user activity. Here are the core functional components:

---

#### **1. User Management & Authentication**
- **User accounts** with:
  - Standard credentials (username/email/password)
  - Login tracking (timestamps, IPs, sign-in count)
  - Password reset functionality
  - "Remember me" sessions
- **Role-based access control**:
  - Many-to-many relationship between users and roles (e.g., "Admin," "Editor")
  - Roles define permissions (implied by schema; exact permissions not specified)
- **Plugins** can be assigned to users (likely for extending functionality per user).

---

#### **2. Content Management**
- **Hierarchical pages**:
  - Nested structure (parent/child relationships via `parent_id`, `lft`/`rgt`/`depth` for tree traversal)
  - Configurable visibility (`show_in_menu`, `draft` status)
  - Customizable URLs (`path`, `slug`) and templates (`view_template`, `layout_template`)
- **Page parts**:
  - Modular content blocks (e.g., "Header," "Footer") with ordering (`position`)
  - Editable independently (e.g., `body` content in translations)
- **Deletion control** (`deletable` flag) and menu behavior (`skip_to_first_child`).

---

#### **3. Multilingual Support**
- **Translations** for:
  - Pages (titles, slugs, menu labels)
  - Page parts (content bodies)
  - Images (alt text, titles)
  - Resources (titles)
- Locale-based variants (`locale` field) with fallback likely handled at application level.

---

#### **4. Media & File Management**
- **Images**:
  - Stored with metadata (dimensions, MIME type, file size)
  - Unique storage identifiers (`image_uid`)
- **Generic resources** (e.g., PDFs, documents):
  - Similar to images but with extensions (`file_ext`) and no dimension tracking.
- Both support translations for display attributes.

---

#### **5. Technical Notes**
- **Activity tracking**: Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) on all tables.
- **URL handling**: Slugs ensure SEO-friendly paths.
- **Plugin system**: User-specific plugins (`name`, `position`) suggest extendable features (e.g., dashboards).

---

### Key Omissions (Not in Schema):
- **Permission granularity**: Roles lack specific permissions (likely defined elsewhere).
- **Frontend rendering**: How templates/pages are served isnâ€™t specified.
- **Plugin implementation**: No details on plugin functionality or hooks.

This schema suggests a **flexible, enterprise-ready CMS** akin to RefineryCMS or similar platforms, with strong i18n support and modular content editing. Engineers can replicate this with:
1. A relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
2. User/auth tables + junction tables for roles
3. Nested set model for pages
4. Translation tables with locale keys
5. File storage (via `*_uid` fields) likely using a service like S3.
