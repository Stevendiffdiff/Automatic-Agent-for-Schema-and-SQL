### Functional Description:

The software is a **user authentication and API management system** with comprehensive tracking capabilities. It provides:  

1. **User Management**  
   - Stores user accounts with email/password or OAuth-based authentication (via `provider` and `provider_id`).  
   - Supports "remember me" functionality (`remember_token`) and password resets (via the `password_resets` table).  
   - Tracks creation and modification timestamps.  

2. **API Key Management**  
   - Users can generate multiple named API keys (`api_keys` table).  
   - Each key is unique and tied to a specific user.  

3. **API Activity Logging**  
   - All API calls are logged (`api_log`), including:  
     - The user or API key used (`user_id`, `api_key_id`).  
     - Image-related data (e.g., uploads or processed images stored as `images`).  
     - Timestamps for auditing.  

4. **Database Migrations**  
   - Tracks schema changes (`migrations` table) with batch support for version control.  

#### Key Relationships:  
- **Users → API Keys**: One-to-many (a user can have multiple keys).  
- **Users/API Keys → API Logs**: One-to-many (both users and keys can generate multiple logs).  

#### Notable Features:  
- **Flexible Auth**: Supports both email/password and OAuth logins.  
- **Security**: Password reset tokens and API keys are securely stored.  
- **Auditability**: Full API call history with user/key attribution.  

This system is typical of a **B2B or developer-focused platform** where API access and user authentication are core requirements. The schema suggests an emphasis on traceability (logs, timestamps) and multi-method authentication.

**Engineer Guidance**: To replicate, prioritize:  
1. User/auth tables with nullable OAuth fields.  
2. API key generation with unique constraints.  
3. Logging all API activity with user/key references.  
4. A migration system for schema updates.  

The design avoids redundancy (e.g., logs reference users/keys rather than duplicating data) and uses standard practices (timestamps, foreign keys).
