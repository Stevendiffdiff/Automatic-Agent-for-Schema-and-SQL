### Functional Description:

The software appears to be a **host monitoring and management system** designed to track and verify the status of remote hosts through automated checks. Here's the core functionality:

#### 1. **Host Management**
- Stores information about monitored hosts, including:
  - Basic identifiers (name, IP, SSH credentials)
  - Network configuration (port)
  - Flexible custom properties (stored as JSON)
- Tracks creation/modification timestamps for audit purposes

#### 2. **Automated Check System**
- Supports multiple types of checks per host (one-to-many relationship)
- Each check has:
  - A specific type (e.g., ping, port check, custom script)
  - Configurable enabled/disabled state
  - Status tracking with detailed run outputs (message + structured JSON data)
  - Scheduling controls (next run timing)
  - Failure notification throttling to prevent alert fatigue

#### 3. **Operational Features**
- Maintains comprehensive check execution history:
  - Last run status and output
  - Precise timing of executions
- Supports custom configurations for both hosts and checks via JSON fields
- Designed for programmatic access through structured data storage

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Infrastructure-focused**: Clearly designed for technical users managing servers/services
- **Automation-ready**: Structured output and scheduling suggest integration with automated systems
- **Extensible**: Custom JSON fields allow for flexible use cases beyond core functionality

The system appears optimized for reliability monitoring with features like status tracking, detailed check outputs, and notification throttling - suggesting it's designed to minimize false alerts while providing comprehensive monitoring data.
