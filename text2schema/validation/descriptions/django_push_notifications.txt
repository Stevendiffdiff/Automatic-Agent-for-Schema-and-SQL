### Functional Description  

The software is a **cross-platform push notification service** integrated with a **user authentication system**. It enables sending targeted push notifications to users across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, and Web) while maintaining user-device associations.  

#### **Core Features:**  

1. **User Authentication & Management**  
   - Stores user credentials (username, hashed password) and profile information (name, email).  
   - Supports role-based access control via `is_superuser`, `is_staff`, and `is_active` flags.  
   - Tracks user activity (`last_login`, `date_joined`).  

2. **Multi-Platform Push Notifications**  
   - **Google Cloud Messaging (GCM/FCM):**  
     - Stores device registration IDs, activity status, and optional metadata (device name, application ID).  
   - **Apple Push Notification Service (APNS):**  
     - Manages iOS device tokens, activation status, and application context.  
   - **Windows Notification Service (WNS):**  
     - Tracks Windows device registrations and user associations.  
   - **Web Push (Browser-Based):**  
     - Supports browser notifications with encryption keys (`p256dh`, `auth`) and browser-specific metadata.  

3. **User-Device Relationships**  
   - Each user can have **multiple registered devices** across platforms (1:N relationships).  
   - Devices are linked to users via foreign keys, enabling targeted notifications.  

#### **Key Functionality:**  
- **Registration & Management:** Users can register devices for push notifications, with support for deactivation (`active` flag).  
- **Cross-Platform Targeting:** Notifications can be sent selectively by platform (e.g., Android-only, Web-only) or to all user devices.  
- **Security:**  
  - User authentication ensures only valid users receive notifications.  
  - Web Push uses encryption for secure delivery.  

#### **Engineering Implications:**  
- The schema supports **scalability** (auto-increment IDs, indexed user-device relationships).  
- **Extensibility:** New platforms can be added with similar device tables (e.g., for future services like Amazon Device Messaging).  

This system is ideal for applications requiring **user-specific, cross-platform notifications**, such as social networks, productivity tools, or e-commerce apps.
