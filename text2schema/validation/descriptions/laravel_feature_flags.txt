### Functional Description: Feature Management System  

This is a **feature management system** that enables:  
1. **Feature Organization**:  
   - Individual features are stored with metadata (name, description, active status, and expiration).  
   - Features can be grouped into logical collections ("feature groups") for bulk management.  
   - Many-to-many relationships exist between features and groups (a feature can belong to multiple groups, and a group can contain multiple features).  

2. **User Assignment**:  
   - Features and feature groups can be assigned to users via many-to-many relationships.  
   - Users can be granted access to:  
     - Individual features (via `feature_user`).  
     - Entire feature groups (via `feature_group_user`), which implicitly grants access to all features in the group.  

3. **Lifecycle Tracking**:  
   - Features and groups support activation/deactivation (`active` flag).  
   - Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) and optional expiration (`expires_at`) enable time-bound control.  

### Key Capabilities:  
- **Granular Control**: Assign features at the individual or group level.  
- **Dynamic Toggling**: Enable/disable features or groups without deletion.  
- **Expiration**: Automatically sunset features via `expires_at`.  

### Engineering Implications:  
- **Junction Tables**: Required for all many-to-many relationships (features↔groups, features↔users, groups↔users).  
- **Foreign Keys**: Ensure referential integrity for assignments.  
- **Nullable Fields**: Optional descriptions and expiration dates provide flexibility.  

This system is typical of **feature flagging**, **entitlement management**, or **permission systems**, where controlled rollout or access to functionality is required.
