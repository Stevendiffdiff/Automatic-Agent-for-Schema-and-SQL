### Functional Description of the CMS Platform:

This is a **multi-site content management system** with robust content organization, multilingual support, and versioning capabilities. The system is designed to manage websites with hierarchical content structures, reusable components, and flexible categorization.

#### Core Functionality:

1. **Multi-site Management**  
   - Supports multiple independent websites (sites) with unique domains/paths  
   - Each site maintains its own content, layouts, files, and categories  
   - Default language configuration per site  

2. **Content Structure**  
   - Pages organized in parent-child hierarchies with manual ordering (position)  
   - Pages can redirect to other pages (target_page_id)  
   - Supports both published and draft states (is_published)  
   - URL management via slugs and full_path tracking  

3. **Multilingual Support**  
   - Translations exist as separate records linked to base content  
   - Each translation can have its own layout override  
   - Published status managed per translation  

4. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Layout templates with HTML/CSS/JS components  
   - Layout inheritance through parent-child relationships  
   - Application layout wrappers (app_layout) for consistent framing  

5. **Content Components**  
   - Reusable snippets (global content fragments)  
   - Flexible fragments that can attach to any content type  
   - Fragments support multiple data types (text, boolean, datetime)  

6. **Organization System**  
   - Category system with polymorphic associations  
   - Content can belong to multiple categories  
   - Categories are scoped to specific content types  

7. **Asset Management**  
   - File uploads with metadata and site association  
   - Human-readable labeling and descriptions  

8. **Version Control**  
   - Full revision history for all content types  
   - Tracks complete record state at each change  

#### Key Relationships:
- All content ties back to a specific site  
- Pages can have translations and child pages  
- Layouts can inherit from parent layouts  
- Categories can organize multiple content types  
- All content types support revision tracking  

The system emphasizes **content reuse** (through snippets, fragments, and layouts), **flexible organization** (via categories and hierarchies), and **multi-site scalability** while maintaining full version history of all changes.
