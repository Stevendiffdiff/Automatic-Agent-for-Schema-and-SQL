### Functional Description: Reaction Tracking System

This system enables users to apply and track reactions (e.g., likes, ratings, or custom emoji) on various content types (reactants) with the following core capabilities:

1. **Reaction Framework**
   - Supports multiple reaction types (e.g., like, love, angry) with configurable weights ("mass")
   - Tracks both simple counts and weighted aggregates
   - Records reaction intensity ("rate") for scaled reactions (e.g., 1-5 stars)

2. **Entity Model**
   - **Reactants**: Content objects that receive reactions (posts, comments, etc.)
   - **Reactors**: Entities that give reactions (users, bots, etc.)
   - Both support polymorphic typing via "type" fields

3. **Analytics Features**
   - Per-reaction-type counters for each content item
   - Real-time aggregated totals (raw count and weighted sum)
   - All records include temporal tracking (created/updated timestamps)

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Dedicated counters table avoids expensive reaction counting queries
   - Pre-computed totals enable fast leaderboard/sorting queries

The system is designed for high-volume interaction tracking while maintaining real-time analytics capabilities. The schema supports polymorphic content and user systems through type identifiers rather than rigid foreign keys.
