### Functional Description of the Music Streaming Service  

The competitor's software is a **music streaming platform** with user accounts, playlist management, and music library organization. The core functionality includes:  

1. **User Management**  
   - Users can register with email/password and have admin privileges (via `is_admin` flag).  
   - Supports "remember me" sessions (`remember_token`) and password resets (`password_resets` table).  
   - Users can store preferences (`preferences` column).  

2. **Authentication & API Access**  
   - Personal access tokens (`personal_access_tokens`) allow API authentication with granular permissions (`abilities`).  
   - Tokens are tied to users or other entities (`tokenable_id`, `tokenable_type`).  

3. **Music Library**  
   - Tracks (`songs`) are organized by **albums** and **artists**, with metadata (title, duration, lyrics, file path).  
   - Albums have cover art (`cover`), and artists have profile images (`image`).  

4. **Playlist System**  
   - Users can create **playlists** (`playlists`), which can be organized into **folders** (`playlist_folders`).  
   - Playlists can contain multiple songs (via `playlist_song` junction table).  
   - Supports rule-based playlists (`rules` column for dynamic filtering).  

5. **User Engagement**  
   - Tracks user interactions (`interactions`), including play counts (`play_count`) and likes (`liked`).  

6. **Application Settings**  
   - Global settings (`settings` table) stored as key-value pairs.  

### Key Relationships  
- **Users** own **playlists** and **folders**.  
- **Playlists** can be nested in **folders** and contain **songs**.  
- **Songs** belong to **albums** and **artists**.  
- **Artists** have multiple **albums** and **songs**.  
- **Users** interact with **songs** (plays, likes).  

This schema suggests a **self-hostable** or **cloud-based** music service with strong playlist customization, user tracking, and API access. The lack of subscription tables implies a focus on personal libraries or ad-supported streaming.
