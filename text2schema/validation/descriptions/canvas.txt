### Functional Description:  

The software is a **content management system (CMS)** focused on publishing and organizing blog-style posts ("canvas posts"). It includes robust analytics for tracking post visits/views, flexible categorization through tags and topics, and user management with extended profile metadata.  

#### Core Features:  

1. **Content Management**  
   - **Posts**: Supports rich text content with titles, summaries, featured images, and metadata. Posts can be published, updated, or soft-deleted.  
   - **URL-friendly slugs**: Each post has a unique, SEO-optimized identifier.  
   - **Categorization**:  
     - **Tags**: User-defined labels for cross-cutting classification (e.g., "Tutorials").  
     - **Topics**: Hierarchical groupings (e.g., "Technology > AI").  
     - Both support many-to-many relationships with posts.  

2. **User System**  
   - **Authentication**: Standard email/password login with "remember me" tokens and email verification.  
   - **Profiles**: Extended metadata (avatars, bios, dark mode preferences, etc.) stored separately from core auth data.  
   - **Ownership**: Users create and manage their posts, tags, and topics.  

3. **Analytics**  
   - **Visits vs. Views**: Tracks initial visits (landings) and subsequent views (engagements) per post.  
   - **Visitor Data**: Captures IP, user agent, and referrer for traffic analysis.  

4. **Soft Deletion**  
   - Posts, tags, and topics can be soft-deleted (hidden but retained in the database).  

#### Key Relationships:  
- **Users → Posts**: One-to-many (a user authors many posts).  
- **Posts ↔ Tags/Topics**: Many-to-many (flexible categorization).  
- **Posts → Visits/Views**: One-to-many (tracking engagement).  
- **Users ↔ Metadata**: One-to-one (extended profile data).  

#### Engineering Notes:  
- **Analytics Separation**: `canvas_visits` and `canvas_views` are distinct tables, suggesting visits track initial access, while views may log repeat interactions.  
- **Extensibility**: JSON `meta` fields in posts and user metadata allow for custom attributes without schema changes.  
- **Soft Deletion**: Implemented via `deleted_at` timestamps (nullable if active).  

This design prioritizes **content organization**, **user customization**, and **audience insights**, typical of a modern blogging platform or knowledge base.
