### Functional Description:

The software is an **access monitoring and security system** that tracks and analyzes user authentication attempts to a web application. It serves two primary purposes:

1. **Successful Access Tracking** (via `axes_accesslog` table):
   - Records all successful logins with timestamps, user details, and access information
   - Tracks session duration through login/logout timestamps
   - Captures client metadata (user agent, IP) and accessed paths

2. **Authentication Attempt Monitoring** (via `axes_accessattempt` table):
   - Records all login attempts (both successful and failed)
   - Stores detailed request data (GET/POST parameters)
   - Maintains failure counters for security analysis
   - Captures the same client metadata as successful accesses

Key Features:
- **Security Analysis**: Tracks failed attempts and patterns (via `failures_since_start`)
- **Forensic Capability**: Stores complete request data for investigation
- **Session Tracking**: Links successful logins to their attempts via username
- **Client Fingerprinting**: Uses user agent, IP, and HTTP headers to identify clients

The system appears designed for:
- Brute force attack detection
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Compliance logging
- User behavior analysis

The data model supports identifying patterns across multiple attempts while maintaining a clear audit trail of successful accesses. The one-to-one relationship suggests the system may correlate successful logins with their preceding attempts for security analysis.
