### Product Description: GitHub Notification & Repository Management Platform  

This is a **GitHub-integrated SaaS platform** that helps users manage repositories, track notifications, and collaborate on issues/pull requests. The core functionality includes:  

#### **1. GitHub App Installation & Permissions**  
- Tracks installations of the GitHub App (OAuth) with granular permissions (pull requests, issues, statuses).  
- Supports multi-account setups (user/organization) and repository-level access control.  
- Manages user permissions via a junction table (`app_installation_permissions`).  

#### **2. Repository Management**  
- Syncs GitHub repositories (public/private) with metadata (owner, last sync time).  
- Links repositories to app installations for permission enforcement.  

#### **3. Notification System**  
- Aggregates GitHub notifications (issues, PRs, comments) with filtering (unread, starred, archived).  
- Tracks notification subjects (title, URL, state) and associates them with repositories/users.  
- Supports user preferences (muting, starring, comment display).  

#### **4. Collaboration Features**  
- **Subjects**: Centralizes GitHub items (issues, PRs) with metadata (state, assignees, comments).  
- **Comments**: Stores threaded discussions with author associations and review states.  
- **Labels**: Manages repository labels (name, color) linked to subjects.  

#### **5. User Experience**  
- **Pinned Searches**: Saves custom queries for quick access.  
- **User Preferences**: Themes, notification display settings, and encrypted token storage (API, personal access tokens).  

#### **6. Subscription & Monetization**  
- Offers tiered plans (monthly/yearly pricing, free trials).  
- Tracks purchases with billing cycles, trial status, and transaction IDs.  

### **Key Differentiators**  
- **Deep GitHub Integration**: Syncs with GitHub’s permission model and real-time activity.  
- **Unified Dashboard**: Combines notifications, repository management, and collaboration tools.  
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Supports teams with granular permissions and audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`).  

This schema suggests a **product similar to GitHub’s native notifications but with enhanced customization, cross-repository visibility, and premium features**. Engineers should focus on GitHub API syncing, permission cascading, and real-time updates.
